            <br></br><br></br>
            <p style={{textAlign: "center"}}>To co-exist with all road users in a way that society considers
         them trustworthy and safe. With an interdisciplinary team of
          researchers from engineering, social science, and the humanities,
           CAV-Lab aims to develop a novel highly automated driving platform
            for HAVs of CCAM using explainable and human-centric AI solutions to
             provide them greater situational awareness, which is holistic and
              inclusive of human values, to ensure that the wider anticipated
               benefits of CCAM are realised.<br></br><br></br>

               The report published by the House of Lords (Marchâ€™17) highlighted
                that although CAVs have the potential to lower the number of
                 road fatalities, casualties, and traffic congestion, the
                  eradication, or near eradication, of human error and traffic
                   load will only be realised with full automation. Major
                   international automotive industries believe artificial
                   intelligence will be the bridge between current automated
                   vehicles and fully autonomous vehicles.<br></br>
                However, the question is: <br></br><br></br></p>
