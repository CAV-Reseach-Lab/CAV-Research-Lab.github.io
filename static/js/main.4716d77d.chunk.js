The goal is to improve vehicle perception and expand the information horizon, while addressing issues such as sensor limitations, real-time decision-making, and line of sight. The expected outcome is the development of safer and faster autonomous vehicles, which will represent the next generation of autonomous technologies. To achieve this goal, the research team of CAV-Lab designed a novel distributed control architecture that combines the power of AI and distributed control systems, with the notion of autonomous systems. We developed a new control platform, which enables the cost-effective deployment of autonomous features and ultimately the realisation of connected and fully autonomous cars. Additionally, we created a cloud-assisted learning control system, which allows the next generation of autonomous cars to perform challenging manoeuvres, such as overtaking, in high-speed and uncertain conditions. We also developed an AI-enabled interactive decision-making system to improve the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in highly dynamic and interactive driving scenarios. Overall, this research project seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in autonomous vehicle technology by leveraging cloud computing, 5G communication technologies, and cutting-edge AI and distributed optimal control theories.

In this article, based on Nick\u2019s book, I would like to highlight the link between Nick\u2019s research and my own on Safe AI for autonomous driving. In his book, Nick challenges many of the widely held beliefs about the nature of our minds. One of the central themes of his book is the idea that our minds don\'t harbour deep unconscious thoughts, desires, or motives. Instead, he argues that our thinking, feelings, and behaviour are constructed on the spot.

Such delays can compromise the accuracy of positional mapping between the local and remote devices which can negatively impact the performance and stability of the system. The research paper written by CAV-Lab researcher, Luc McCutcheon, focuses on addressing the challenge of synchronising the actions of the local and remote devices despite the presence of stochastic time delays.

On the other hand, a rational agent is one who consistently makes choices based on logical and deliberate analysis, utilising their slow, effortful, and logical thinking. Kahneman argues that while the idea of a rational agent may be an idealised theoretical construct, in reality, humans tend to be more akin to reasonable agents, as the limitations of our cognitive processes often hinder purely rational decision-making.
