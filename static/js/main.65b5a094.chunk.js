The project aims to integrate off-board vehicle information into on-board vehicle control systems using cloud, 5G communication technologies, AI, and distributed optimal control theories. The goal is to improve vehicle perception and expand the information horizon, while addressing issues such as sensor limitations, real-time decision-making, and line of sight. The expected outcome is the development of safer and faster autonomous vehicles, which will represent the next generation of autonomous technologies. To achieve this goal, the research team of CAV-Lab designed a novel distributed control architecture that combines the power of AI and distributed control systems, with the notion of autonomous systems. We developed a new control platform, which enables the cost-effective deployment of autonomous features and ultimately the realisation of connected and fully autonomous cars. Additionally, we created a cloud-assisted learning control system, which allows the next generation of autonomous cars to perform challenging manoeuvres, such as overtaking, in high-speed and uncertain conditions. We also developed an AI-enabled interactive decision-making system to improve the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in highly dynamic and interactive driving scenarios. Overall, this research project seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in autonomous vehicle technology by leveraging cloud computing, 5G communication technologies, and cutting-edge AI and distributed optimal control theories.

The aim here is to enhance the trust of AI-enabled autonomous vehicles by public. In this project, the backbone of our research is Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) which combines artificial neural networks with a framework of reinforcement learning. DRL offers a comprehensive framework for studying the interplay among learning, representation, and decision making, offering to the sciences and researchers a new set of research tools and a wide range of novel research hypotheses. DRL borrows ideas not only from nature but also from our psychology making a bridge between technology and humans. However, there is a concern about the trustworthiness and interpretability of DRL and its application to autonomous vehicles from society. A precise answer to this concern will require understanding both what responsibility and trust mean for autonomous vehicles and its makers and operators, and of how the design and operation of an autonomous vehicle can be undertaken to enable responsibility and trust. I have recently built a core research team at the University of Surrey to answer these questions. The team includes colleagues from the Faculty of Arts and Human Sciences who are experts in interpreting human values (e.g. legality, ethics and privacy) and phycology as well as the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences who are experts in artificial intelligence and robotic systems.

The project is a collaboration between leading experts from academia, industry, and governments, with the aim of pushing the boundaries of AI robotics and enabling robots to operate safely in hazardous and extreme environments such as space and nuclear plants. During this project, we developed novel control and navigation algorithms using state-of-the-art machine learning and AI techniques, to empower the next generation of robots to perform tasks autonomously and safely. Our work focused specifically on addressing the challenges of safe and resilient operation of tele-operated robotic systems under random communication time-delays, autonomous operation of manipulators in free-gravity conditions, and energy management of robotic systems with limited energy resources for remote exploration.

The project aims to integrate off-board vehicle information into on-board vehicle control systems using cloud, 5G communication technologies, AI, and distributed optimal control theories. The goal is to improve vehicle perception and expand the information horizon, while addressing issues such as sensor limitations, real-time decision-making, and line of sight. The expected outcome is the development of safer and faster autonomous vehicles, which will represent the next generation of autonomous technologies. To achieve this goal, the research team of CAV-Lab designed a novel distributed control architecture that combines the power of AI and distributed control systems, with the notion of autonomous systems. We developed a new control platform, which enables the cost-effective deployment of autonomous features and ultimately the realisation of connected and fully autonomous cars. Additionally, we created a cloud-assisted learning control system, which allows the next generation of autonomous cars to perform challenging manoeuvres, such as overtaking, in high-speed and uncertain conditions. We also developed an AI-enabled interactive decision-making system to improve the safe operation of autonomous vehicles in highly dynamic and interactive driving scenarios. Overall, this research project seeks to advance the state-of-the-art in autonomous vehicle technology by leveraging cloud computing, 5G communication technologies, and cutting-edge AI and distributed optimal control theories. The ultimate goal is to create safer and faster autonomous vehicles that can operate in a variety of challenging driving scenarios."))),r.a.createElement("div",{class:"grid-item"},r.a.createElement("img",{style:{paddingTop:"4rem",paddingBottom:"1rem",height:"clamp(35rem, 70%, 43rem)",width:"clamp(25rem, 80%, 30rem)"},class:"project-img",src:a(36)})),r.a.createElement("div",{style:{color:"black",textAlign:"justify",marginLeft:"3%"}},r.a.createElement("h1",null,r.a.createElement("span",{className:"orange_underline"},"Socio-Drive")),r.a.createElement("br",null),r.a.createElement("p",{style:{paddingLeft:"3%",paddingRight:"3%"}},"Socio-Drive (Cognitive Learning of Scoial Norms for Human-like Autonomous Driving) research project was launched in 2017 with initial funding from EPSRC and Jaguar Land Rover. The aim here is to enhance the trust of AI-enabled autonomous vehicles by public. In this project, the backbone of our research is Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) which combines artificial neural networks with a framework of reinforcement learning. DRL offers a comprehensive framework for studying the interplay among learning, representation, and decision making, offering to the sciences and researchers a new set of research tools and a wide range of novel research hypotheses. DRL borrows ideas not only from nature but also from our psychology making a bridge between technology and humans. However, there is a concern about the trustworthiness and interpretability of DRL and its application to autonomous vehicles from society. A precise answer to this concern will require understanding both what responsibility and trust mean for autonomous vehicles and its makers and operators, and of how the design and operation of an autonomous vehicle can be undertaken to enable responsibility and trust. I have recently built a core research team at the University of Surrey to answer these questions. The team includes colleagues from the Faculty of Arts and Human Sciences who are experts in interpreting human values (e.g. legality, ethics and privacy) and phycology as well as the Faculty of Engineering and Physical Sciences who are experts in artificial intelligence and robotic systems.
